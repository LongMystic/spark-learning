## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Initialize Git Repository (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
cd spark-learning
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Spark Deep Dive learning repository"
```

### 2. Start Learning!

1. **Read GETTING_STARTED.md** - Understand the learning path
2. **Start Day 1** - Read `01-fundamentals/day-01-execution-model.md`
3. **Run Exercise 1** - Complete `exercises/fundamentals/exercise-01-dag-analysis.py`
4. **Update Progress** - Mark Day 1 complete in `PROGRESS.md`

### 3. Daily Routine

- **Morning**: Read the day's lesson (30-45 min)
- **Afternoon**: Complete exercises (30-60 min)
- **Evening**: Experiment and document (15-30 min)

### 4. Customize for Your Environment

- Update exercise files with your actual table paths
- Modify configurations for your cluster
- Document environment-specific findings in `notes/`

## 📊 Learning Path Overview

### Week 1: Deep Fundamentals
- Days 1-2: ✅ Ready
- Days 3-7: Will be created as you progress

### Week 2: Performance Tuning
- Structure ready, content to be added

### Week 3: Troubleshooting
- Structure ready, content to be added

### Week 4+: Advanced & Production
- Structure ready, content to be added

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Be Consistent**: Even 30 minutes daily is better than long sessions
2. **Practice Hands-On**: Run code on your actual cluster
3. **Use Spark UI**: Always analyze execution in Spark UI
4. **Take Notes**: Document insights in `notes/` directory
5. **Apply Immediately**: Try optimizations on real jobs

## 🎯 Your Mission

By the end of this journey, you will:
- ✅ Design efficient Spark jobs
- ✅ Optimize for performance
- ✅ Troubleshoot production issues
- ✅ Tune Spark for on-premise clusters
- ✅ Master Spark Thrift, Streaming, and PySpark

## 📝 Progress Tracking

Update `PROGRESS.md` regularly:
- Mark completed days
